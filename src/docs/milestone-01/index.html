          <h2>Overview</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>TransKnowledge</strong> is a carefully crafted web application
          that seeks to centralize information and resources for transgender
          people’s wellbeing. Misinformation about transitioning is widespread,
          especially given how many trans communities are private for safety
          reasons. For trans people who are currently in the closet or have few
          real life trans peers, finding reliable information about
          transitioning is a daunting task, much less finding a safe community.
          Featuring not only a user-updated repository of trans information and
          resources, but a trans law heatmap, trans news feed, and moderated
          community forum, any information a trans person needs to thrive and
          make educated decisions can be found. TransKnowledge seeks to serve
          all members of the trans community, regardless of age, ability, or
          technological literacy, by having a simple-to-use, minimalist
          interface and clear focus points. Through this process, trans people
          of all stripes can be sure they are getting reliable information
          without scouring the internet and can find community where one may not
          exist in their real-world location.

        <div class="header">
          <button type="button" class="tab">Expand</button>
          <h2>Application Parts</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            There are four foundational elements that make up the TransKnowledge
            application. First is the <strong>Trans Map</strong>, which provides
            users with an easily-understood map interface, showing the current
            legal situation for trans people in all states. Not only is more
            information about each state provided, but a route mode allows
            mapping between areas using trans friendly states, ideal for making
            road trips that avoid danger as much as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>Trans News</strong> page aggregates and filters
            information from all across the political spectrum, allowing each
            member to stay informed on latest news without needlessly subjecting
            themselves to hateful rhetoric. It also features an RSS feed for
            delivering information seamlessly and the ability to add other news
            feeds as desired. This process exemplifies the project’s mission of
            finding trustworthy information on trans issues and making it as
            accessible as possible to digest, while still providing choice in
            the user’s desired sources of information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users can ask questions and seek reassurance with other members of
            the community on the <strong>Community Forums</strong> page helping
            to reduce the effects of isolation, especially with people who are
            still in the closet. Incorporating an accessible moderation tool of
            reporting low-quality or hateful posts in its interconnected
            platform while respecting anonymity fosters a safe and respectful
            community.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>Resources</strong> page is an archive of information,
            divided into subject matter of most interest to a wide variety of
            trans people, such as accessing medical information and
            understanding legal name and gender changes. Through a moderated
            user submission form, the page can become a living document, able to
            change with new, reliable information while keeping demand on a
            single person to update it as minimal as possible.
          </p>

      <article id="data-requirements">
        <div class="header">
          <button type="button" class="tab">Expand</button>
          <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The purpose of TransKnowledge is to act as a data repository,
            carefully curated to maintain user safety and veracity, yet
            continuously updated with the latest information and maintaining
            accessibility to non-tech literate users. As such, the data sources
            were chosen to balance these characteristics as much as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The foundation of TransKnowledge is built on user-sourced
            information, both through interpersonal interaction in community
            forums and in contributed updates to resources. The type of data is
            relatively simple, being entirely plaintext submitting in a
            particular form and not tracking any identifiable user data.
            However, it also requires moderation by humans involved with the
            project. This moderation is fundamental in keeping the site safe and
            alive, which demands the data are retrievable in a human-readable
            format and easily added to the final project if approved.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Trans Map page requires GPS data for mapping routes between
            areas. This will be sourced from a preexisting service such as the
            Google Maps API, with specific demands that include avoiding certain
            destinations whenever possible. This routing capability makes it
            possible to take away the fear of long-distance trips and encourages
            mutual aid to places that are undergoing a shift to hateful
            policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The news feed requires automatic retrieval of the latest news
            articles from a large number of publications. This will most likely
            be possible through either API data or an RSS feed. However, in
            order to ensure that the users only see data pertaining to trans
            issues, it will be required to automatically filter for articles
            about trans issues. Some APIs, such as the New York Times, have
            tagging data set up already, but for others, it may be necessary to
            create a filter that searches articles for keywords pertaining to
            trans issues and selects the ones that meet a particular threshold.
            The creation of this filter will reduce the difficulty of
            researching and keeping up to date on trans news, allowing
            information to disseminate to more people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the resources page acts as a database of reliable external
            resources for trans interests, centralizing information to a larger
            and less technologically savvy user base. Vital to the project is
            proper categorization, which can reduce the mental load on users and
            increase the number of resources feasible to keep at a time. Ease of
            updating will also ensure that the information is up to date and
            incorrect information is removed to prevent further misinformation
            within the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            By combining crowdsourced information with focused web design
            elements, this platform balances stability with breadth, which
            encourages a degree of longevity that would not exist with a typical
            consolidated repository of information.

            The core design of TransKnowledge is based around minimalist
            elements to facilitate its role as a space of knowledge and for ease
            of use to serve all members of the trans community.

            The Trans Map page features an interactive map of the United States
            and three optional floating boxes used for route input, details of
            the route chosen, and details of the state selected. By keeping the
            map as the central focus, it is simple for users to immediately
            understand and internalize the makeup of the United States
            concerning transgender laws. The optional boxes allow for more
            information only when needed.

            The Trans News page is centered around news articles featured in a
            reader view, with an RSS feed and source selector off to the sides.
            Plenty of space is dedicated to the articles, as the user will spend
            the vast majority of their time solely reading them. The news
            filters are the secondary point of interest, which is why they are
            given a large sidebar off to the side.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img

          <p>
            The Community Forums feature a social media-like design of anonymous
            posts in a center column in chronological order, with replies and
            reports in floating boxes. By keeping the UI and minimalist, the
            design will be welcoming to those familiar and unfamiliar with
            social media alike. Likewise, the reply and report buttons are the
            only ones available to encourage positive interaction with other
            users and to help older or less technologically savvy users
            understand it.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="wireframe-resources.png"

            >
          </figure>
          <p>
            Finally, the Resources page uses a hierarchical model, with the
            section selector as a sidebar and the resources given plenty of
            space in the middle. This type of layout should be familiar to users
            from features like the iOS settings page, encouraging interaction
            and keeping the page neatly ordered for ease of use. Given that most
            users will be reading resources more than they will be submitting
            new sources, that feature is given less prominence in the corner.

          <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The unfortunate reality of information on trans issues is that it is
            dispersed and kept within communities, as a result of the everyday
            violence experienced by trans people. With TransKnowledge, isolated
            trans people can find support with one web application. A vital
            aspect is combining moderation with user-submitting content. This
            allows the Resources page to balance adapting new knowledge as
            needed with keeping out harmful false information and allows the
            Community Forums to prevent bad actors from causing harm without
            gatekeeping the space away from those who need it most. For
            instance, a trans person who learned of an online store that sold
            hormone replacement medication could check to see if there was any
            information about it on the site, as a number of similar stores do
            not sell what they claim to. Likewise, the Trans Map page provides a
            perspective on which states have the most and least legal protection
            for trans people, which gives actionable information on where users
            can go to be safe. Taken together, TransKnowledge would reduce the
            effects of misinformation that isolated trans people would be at
            risk of.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, many trans people who are particularly at risk of
            isolation and misinformation are people unaccustomed to technology,
            given that a growing proportion of trans communities rely on online
            communication. The streamlined design of TransKnowledge is targeted
            to make less tech-literate people comfortable, allowing them access
            to information and community they might not otherwise have.

          <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The creation of TransKnowledge requires skills obtained throughout
            the entirety of my university experience. As an Informatics &amp;
            Social Thought and Political Economy (STPEC) double major, the focus
            of my education has been on understanding how to use and communicate
            information and understanding minority community interests. In
            particular, my GenEd course BIOLOGY105H: Biology of Social Issues
            and INFO348: Predictive Analytics in Python were instrumental in
            understanding how to find accurate information about minority
            communities and how to coalesce and communicate efficiently. One of
            the Integrative Experience requirements is interdisciplinary
            perspective-taking, which this project has in spades, from computer
            science skills in how data can be aggregated and distributed to
            STPEC skills in understanding and addressing the needs of a
            particular community.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, my experience as a trans person who came out during my
            time at university has also informed the goals and structure of
            TransKnowledge. I was in a similar position as my intended user
            base. I had few real life trans relationships I could draw on for
            knowledge and being swarmed by misinformation. As such, I drew on
            what I needed most: information about trans laws in various states,
            a way to aggregate trans news articles without subjecting myself to
            hate speech, a community, and vetted resources. As such, this
            project acts as a culmination of my particular education and social
            experience in university.
